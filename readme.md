# 🔧 LAMP Stack Deployment Projects: Manual & Automated (Ansible)


Welcome to my portfolio project showcasing two approaches to deploying a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on AWS EC2:


- ✅ Manual Deployment: Command-by-command installation

- 🤖 Automated Deployment: Infrastructure as Code using Ansible


This project demonstrates foundational skills in Linux administration, cloud infrastructure (AWS), and automation — essential for roles in DevOps, Cloud, System Admin, and Cybersecurity.
